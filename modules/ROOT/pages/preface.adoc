== Preface

Welcome to Hackfables, a collection of short parables for software engineers.

These stories are designed to be read quickly but pondered slowly. Each parable captures a common theme or lesson from engineering practice: trade-offs, teamwork, clarity, humility, and craft.

Contributions are welcomeâ€”see the project README for how to add your own parable.
