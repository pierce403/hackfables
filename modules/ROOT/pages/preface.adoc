== Preface

Welcome to Hack Fables, a collection of short parables for hackers.

These stories are designed to be read quickly but pondered slowly. Each parable captures a common theme or lesson from engineering practice: trade-offs, teamwork, clarity, humility, and craft. They are ideally each represent real events or situations, distilled into easily digestible hacker folklore. Enjoy!

Contributions are welcomeâ€”see the project README for how to add your own parable.
