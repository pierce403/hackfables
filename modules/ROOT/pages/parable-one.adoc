= The Patchwork Programmer

A programmer inherited a codebase stitched together by many hands.

They asked, "Should I rewrite it all?"

The mentor replied, "Mend what tears, reinforce what frays, and add lining where it rubs. A new quilt looks fine on the bed, but it does not keep you warm until it is tested by winter."

== Moral

Refactor along the path of change. Wholesale rewrites are luxuries seldom afforded.
