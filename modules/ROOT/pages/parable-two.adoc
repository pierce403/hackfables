= The Monolith and the Ant

An architect split a monolith into many tiny services.

Traffic came, and the team grew weary of the latency between them.

They asked a wise SRE, "How small should a service be?"

The SRE answered, "As small as it must be to evolve without ceremony, and as large as it must be to carry its own weight."

== Moral

Boundaries exist to serve change, not fashion.
