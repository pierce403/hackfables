= The Hamster, the Ferret, and the FireSheep

Hamster and Ferret ran around town, slipping by open windows and plucking warm cookies from kitchen counters. It was easy. No one noticed.

They warned everyoneâ€”the police, the baker, even the mayor. "Your cookies are being taken through open windows," they said. But no one cared. The cookies kept disappearing, and soon the real criminals started doing it more and more.

One day, FireSheep came to town. The first ones FireSheep told were the children.

With this new knowledge, the children began taking cookies from the windows. Suddenly, the town newspaper paid attention. Parents complained. The mayor convened a meeting. And, at last, people started closing their windows at night.

== Moral

Awareness without accessibility is apathy. When everyone can see the risk, everyone can help fix it.
